1. What does HTML stand for and what its oriary purpose in web development
HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." It is the standard markup language used for creating and 
structuring content on the World Wide Web (WWW). HTML is the foundation of web development, and its primary 
purpose is to define the structure and elements of a web page.

2. Explain the difference between HTML elements and HTML attributes. Provide examples of each
HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages. They define the structure and content of different parts of a 
web page. Each HTML element is enclosed within opening and closing tags, with the content placed between these tags. 
The opening tag contains the element name, and the closing tag has the same name but with a forward slash before 
the element name. Some elements don't require a closing tag and are self-closing.
Examples:
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
<h1>This is a heading element</h1>
<ul>
  <li>List item 1</li>
  <li>List item 2</li>
</ul>

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are specified within the opening tag of an 
element and are used to modify the behavior, appearance, or other aspects of the element. 
Examples:
<a> element has an "href" attribute specifying the URL and a "target" attribute with the value "_blank" to open
the link in a new tab.
<img> element has "src," "alt," "width," and "height" attributes to define the image source, alternative text, 
and dimensions.

3. What is the purpose of the "DOCTYPE" declaration in an HTML document? What happens if you omit it?
The DOCTYPE declaration in an HTML document serves a crucial role in specifying the document type and version of 
HTML being used. It tells web browsers how to interpret and render the content of the HTML document. The DOCTYPE 
declaration is typically placed at the very beginning of an HTML file. 
WHEN IT IS OMITTED
I. Without a DOCTYPE declaration, some browsers may enter "quirks mode" or "almost standards mode." In this mode, 
the browser tries to mimic the behavior of older, non-standard versions of HTML, which can lead to inconsistent 
rendering between different browsers. Elements may be displayed differently, and certain features may not work as 
expected.
II. Omitting the DOCTYPE declaration can lead to layout issues, where elements are positioned and sized differently
than intended, causing a lack of visual consistency across browsers.
III. Web pages without a DOCTYPE declaration are more likely to encounter compatibility problems with modern browsers. 
Newer HTML features and standards may not be properly supported, leading to a suboptimal user experience.

4. Describe the difference between inline elements and block-level elements in HTML. Give examples of each.
Block-level elements are used to create the main structural elements of a webpage, and they typically start 
on a new line and occupy the full width of their parent container. These elements create distinct "blocks" or 
sections of content.
Examples: 
<p>, <div>, <h1>
Inline elements, on the other hand, do not create new blocks but rather flow within the content of block-level 
elements, typically staying on the same line as surrounding text or elements. Inline elements are used to style or 
emphasize specific parts of the content. They cannot contain block-level elements but can contain other inline 
elements
Examples
<img>, <em>, <strong>, <img>


5. Explain the significance of the following HTML tags and their usage:
<head> : The <head> tag is not meant for visible content but contains metadata and other essential information 
about the HTML document. It's placed before the <body> tag and is used to provide instructions to the browser, 
search engines, and other tools.
<div> : The <div> tag is a versatile and generic container used to group and structure content. It's often 
used in combination with CSS for styling and layout purposes. <div> does not inherently change the appearance of 
the content; its primary purpose is to create logical divisions within the page.
<a> : The <a> (anchor) tag is used to create hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate from one webpage to another or 
to different sections within the same page. It requires the href attribute, which specifies the destination URL.
<img> : The <img> tag is used to embed images in a webpage. It requires the src attribute to specify the image 
file's source (URL or local path) and often uses the alt attribute for an alternative text description, which is 
crucial for accessibility.
<ul> : Unordered list. Represents a bulleted list where the order of items doesn't matter.
<ol> : Ordered list. Represents a numbered list where the order of items matters.
<li> :  List item. Represents individual items within a list.

6. What are semantic HTML elements? Provide examples of semantic elements and explain why they are important for web accessibility and SEO.
Semantic HTML elements are HTML tags that carry meaning and convey the structure of the content they enclose. 
These elements provide valuable information about the type and purpose of the content, making it easier for both 
browsers and other systems (such as search engines and assistive technologies) to understand the document's structure 
and content
Examples:
<header> and <footer>:
<header>: Represents the introductory content of a section or the top of a page, often containing the site's logo, navigation, or heading.
<footer>: Represents the closing content of a section or the bottom of a page, often containing copyright information or related links.
Importance: Semantic headers and footers help screen readers and search engines identify important sections of the page, improving accessibility and SEO.


7. What is the purpose of the HTML form element (<form>) and its associated form controls?
Provide examples of common form controls.
The <form> element in HTML is used to create interactive forms on web pages. Forms allow users to input and 
submit data, such as text, selections, or files, to the server for processing. The <form> element acts as a 
container for various form controls (also known as form elements or input fields), which define the types of 
data the user can provide and how that data is collected
